## useful for cases where different file structures exist between machines

# md5 recursive on linux
### source: https://askubuntu.com/a/907955/420815
find . -type f -exec md5sum '{}' \; > md5sum1.txt

# md5 recursive on macOS
find . -type f -exec md5 -r '{}' \; > md5sum2.txt

# compare files 
## read files into dictionary - python
remote = {line.split()[0]: line.split()[1] for line in open("md5sum1.txt")}
local = {line.split()[0]: line.split()[1] for line in open("md5sum2.txt")}
## get files that are different on the remote - python
filelist = [remote[key] for key in set(remote).difference(set(local))]
with open("filesonremote.txt","w") as outfile:
     for item in filelist:
     	 outfile.write("{}\n".format(item))

# copy files
rsync -auv --progress --files-from=filesonremote.txt server:/pathtodir/ .
